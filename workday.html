      <h1 class="title1"> What is Workday Student ?</h1>
      <p class="description"> Traditionally, Workday is a cloud-based software that helps businesses manage HR and finances.</p> 
      <p class="description">The platform also offers Workday Student which is a cloud-based student information system that offers a  solution for managing student and faculty data, financial aid, and more. While,  Workday for managing the busy and often complex processes within higher education sounds like a good idea, it’s execution is another story. </p>
      <center><hr class="divider"/> </center>
      <br>
      <h2 class="title1"> The Problem</h2>
      <p class="description"> Workday Student is a complex system that is not user-friendly. It is difficult to navigate and understand. This makes it hard for students and faculty to use the system effectively. </p>

      <center><hr class="divider"/> </center>
      <br />
      <h2 class="title1"> The Solution</h2>
      <p class="description"> My solution is to redesign Workday Student to make it more user-friendly. This will involve improving the navigation, layout, and overall user experience of the platform's AI feature. </p>
      <img src="IBM Project /1.png" class="screenshots" alt="..." width="750" height="560">
      <p class="subtitle"> Tackling the Navigation</p>
      <p class="description"> Workday Student's original side bar menu is cluttered with no organization of the apps offered to the user. User's can toggle between different layouts like 'frequently used' or 'recently used'  but neither of them group the apps imto clear catagories.</p>
      <img src="IBM Project /problem2.png" class="screenshots" alt="..." width="750" height="560">
      <p class="description"> In the screenshot below, I have reorganized the side bar menu to group the apps into clear catagories. This will make it easier for users to find the app they need. </p>
      <img src="IBM Project /2.png" class="screenshots" alt="..." width="750" height="560">
      <p class="description">In the screenshot below the catagories expand to reveal the different apps that the Workday Student application offers.</p>
      <img src="IBM Project /3.png" class="screenshots" alt="..." width="750" height="560">
      <p class="subtitle"> Tackling the AI Feature</p>
      <p class="description"> Workday Student's built-in AI feature seems to not be very student focused, as you can see most of it's capabilites don't seem to be ones that emphasize the student needs that the software tries to tareget. Instead the AI offers features that seem to be more focused on organization for admin instead of services like highlighting deadlines for students or registering them for classes.</p>
      <img src="IBM Project /Probem3.png" class="screenshots" alt="..." width="750" height="560">
      <p class="subtitle" > My AI's purpose and ethical philosophy</p>
      <p class="description"> In the screenshot below, I have redesigned the AI feature to make it more user-focused. The AI feature will now be able to  provide critical information to users and opens up a pathway for them to complete those critical tasks like setting up advisor meetings.. </p>
      <img src="IBM Project /AI.png" class="screenshots" alt="..." width="750" height="560">
      <p class="description"> When it comes to fleshing out the ethical implications behind the AI, I used the  5 pillars of AI Design that my cohort learned in the IBM Accelerate Program.</p>
      <p class="description"> The 5 pillars are: Fairness, Explainability, Robustness, Privacy, and Transparency. </p>
      <p class="description"> Explainability: The AI would break down time sensitive information like registration and financial deadlines in a digestible manor so user’s are extremely clear on what action items they need to take care of and when. </p>

        <p class="description"> Fairness: The AI will not discriminate on basis of grades or financial aid status when reminding users of tasks to ensure user’s don’t feel singled out due to personal circumstances. </p>
        
        <p class="description"> Robustness: It would provide user-friendly error explanations when errors that cause deadlines not to populate. </p>
        
        <p class="description"> Transparency: The AI would only explicitly pull from permissions that the user clearly agrees to and nothing else.</p>
        
        <p class="description"> Privacy: The AI will not be sharing any of the information it uses to generate the users deadlines. For example, any financial deadline  information about payments won’t be shared to any other users of the platform like advisors . </p>
        <center><hr class="divider"/>
          <h2 class="title1"> The Results</h2>
          <p class="description"> The redesign of Workday Student has made the platform more user-friendly. The new navigation and AI feature make it easier for students and faculty to use the platform effectively. </p>
